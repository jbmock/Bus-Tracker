# Bus-Tracker
Description: Working with the DOM to add markers and create map animations are 2 key components of this project. The onclick event allows for more user interactivity as the user then has control of when and how fast the tracker moves along the bus route on the map.

How to Run: Load the index.html file in your browser and click the button that says, “Start Bus Route from MIT to Harvard” located at the top-left of the screen. The bus tracker will start to move. Click the button again to see the tracker movement increase in speed.

Future Improvements: I would like to include a feature that targets the bus tracker keeping it in the center of the page as it moves along the route. It would also be neat to include a trail as the route unfolds leaving a line to show the complete route once animation has finished. One last thing to improve is having the tracker reset after completing the route upon clicking the button again.
